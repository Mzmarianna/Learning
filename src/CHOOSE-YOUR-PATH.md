2. **You'll save $5,640/year** ($470/mo × 12)
3. **You can focus on students** (not servers)
4. **It scales to 100K+ users** (more than enough)
5. **Zero maintenance** (vs ongoing DevOps work)

- 💰 Hire a teacher
- 💰 Or just survive longer as a startup

1. Use PATH 1 (Simple) RIGHT NOW
2. Deploy in 10 minutes
3. Get students using it TODAY
4. Focus on growth, not infrastructure
5. Save $8,484 over 2 years

### **Later (if needed):**
1. When you hit 50,000+ users
2. When you raise Series A
3. When you hire a DevOps team
4. THEN consider PATH 2
