## 💡 **MY HONEST RECOMMENDATION**

### **Use SIMPLE (Netlify + Supabase) if:**
- ✅ You want to launch in the next hour
- ✅ You have < 50,000 active users
- ✅ You want to focus on product, not infrastructure
- ✅ You want to save money ($0 vs $470/month)
- ✅ You don't have a DevOps team
- ✅ You want automatic everything

**THIS IS YOU RIGHT NOW. Use the simple version!** ⭐

### **Use COMPLEX (Google Cloud) only if:**
- ⚠️ You have 100,000+ active users RIGHT NOW
- ⚠️ You have specific compliance requirements
- ⚠️ You have a DevOps team
- ⚠️ You need custom server infrastructure
- ⚠️ You're funded and cost isn't a concern

**You can always migrate later when you actually need it!**
