## ❌ **WHAT'S MISSING**

### **1. NO Homeschooling Education** ❌

**What Prospects Learn About Homeschooling:**
- ❌ Nothing substantial
- ❌ No "Why homeschool neurodivergent kids" content
- ❌ No homeschool success stories
- ❌ No "How to homeschool ADHD kids" guide
- ❌ No curriculum comparison (traditional vs. neuro-affirming)

**Current Homeschool Mentions:**
- ✅ SEO keywords mention "homeschool ADHD"
- ✅ One testimonial: "Jennifer L., Homeschool mom of 3"
- ✅ FAQ: "Is this replacing education or supplementing it?" → "Either! Use as complete homeschool curriculum OR after-school support"

**That's it.** Not enough to educate or build trust!

---

### **2. NO E-Book Lead Magnet** ❌

**Current Lead Generation:**
- ❌ No e-book
- ❌ No downloadable guide
- ❌ No email capture before quiz
- ❌ No "5 Mistakes Homeschool Parents Make with ADHD Kids"
- ❌ No "Complete Guide to Neurodivergent Homeschooling"

**What You Have:**
- ✅ Placement quiz (requires no email)
- ✅ Sign-up form (only at end of funnel)

**Problem:** You're not capturing emails early! If someone takes the quiz but doesn't sign up, they're GONE forever.

---

### **3. NO Trust-Building Content** ❌

**What's Missing:**
- ❌ No blog with homeschool tips
- ❌ No video from you (Marianna) explaining your approach
- ❌ No case studies or success stories
- ❌ No "Day in the Life" of a student
- ❌ No comparison: Traditional School vs. Homeschool vs. Mz. Marianna's
- ❌ No educational resources for parents

**What You Have:**
- ✅ 3 testimonials (very brief)
- ✅ FAQ section (4 questions)
- ✅ Feature list

**Not enough to overcome skepticism!**
