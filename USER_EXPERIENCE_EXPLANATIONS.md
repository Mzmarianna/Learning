   3. Practice daily read-alouds with parent (10-15 min)
   4. Incorporate unicorn-themed challenges
   5. Build confidence through small, achievable wins

   Timeline: With consistent practice, we expect to see
   improvement in reading fluency within 4-6 weeks.

   Next Steps:
   If you'd like to enroll Emma in our tutoring program,
   she'll love the gamified Learning Kingdom where she can
   earn badges, unlock characters, and go on reading adventures!
